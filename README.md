# Bugs/Improvements

- Why does the pokemon detail page never stop loading?
- Can we fix it so hitting the back button doesn't make the pokemon list reload every time? Kind of ruins the SPA aspect?
- The [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) only shows 20 resuls at a time, can we add a feature that allows people to view the next page?
- Rather than showing all of the poke-sprites at once on the detail page, can we make that rotate every 5ish seconds?
- For the headers (abilities, moves, etc) on the pokemon details page, can we make them sticky when scrolling?

If you find there are bad patterns in here so feel free to refactor as you see fit to do things the more "Angular" way.
